    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with wide, flat sheets of pasta
      layered with meat sauce, cheese, and other ingredients. <br />The pasta
      used for lasagna can either refer to the type of noodle or to the dish
      itself. Lasagna is usually rectangular or <br />ribbon-shaped and thicker
      than tagliatelle. It is a popular dish that has been enjoyed for centuries
      in Italy and around the world.
